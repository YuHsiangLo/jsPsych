    <h2 style="text-align: center">Informed Consent to Participate in Research</h2>

    <p>
        We would like to invite you to participate in a research study examining various aspects of speech production and perception.
        This study is being conducted as part of Roger Yu-Hsiang Lo's Ph.D. dissertation research by Dr. Kathleen Currie Hall, an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia and Roger Yu-Hsiang Lo, a Ph.D. candidate in the same department.
        If you agree to take part in this research, you will be asked to take part in one experiment.
        Your participation may involve up to 1 hour of your time.
        We will ask for some personal information about you such as, "What languages do you speak?" and "Where have you lived in your life?".
        During the experiment you may be asked to produce words and/or listen to sounds.
    </p>

    <p>
    <div><strong>Purpose of study</strong></div>
    <div>The purpose of this study is to examine how people perceive and produce speech.</div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Study procedures</strong></div>
    <div>
        If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked either to listen to speech sounds over headphones and respond to the sounds on a keyboard or a button-box attached to a computer, or to produce speech sounds when prompted on a computer screen, which will then be recorded.
        In some cases, you may be asked to assess the voices of the talkers. You will also be asked personal demographic questions, such as "native language", "ethnicity", and "occupation".
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Benefits</strong></div>
    <div>
        There are no foreseeable direct benefits to you, the participant.
        It is hoped that the results of this research will benefit the greater understanding of speech processes.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Risks/discomforts</strong></div>
    <div>
        If you participate in this experiment, there are no risks greater than what you would experience in your daily life.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Confidentiality</strong></div>
    <div>
        All of the information that we obtain from you during the research will be kept confidential.
        Your data will be anonymized and only identified with an arbitrary subject number, which is not associated with your name or any identifying information about you.
        However, since you need to communicate with experimenters via email, your participation will be and only be known to the PI and co-investigators.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Data storage</strong></div>
    <div>
        Right after you finish the experiment, your anonymized response data will be stored temporarily on a shared server located in UBC, Vancouver, Canada.
        The data will then be transferred to a local machine belonging to Roger Yu-Hsiang Lo for analysis.
        Your questionnaire responses will be stored on the UBC Qualtrics server.
        Upon the completion of the study, your questionnaire responses will remain on the UBC Qualtrics drive, but your experiment data will be transferred and stored on a secure, password- protected computer in the Communication Dynamics Lab and on a personal, encrypted, and password-protected drive belonging to Roger Yu-Hsiang Lo for at least five years.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Potential future use of the collected data</strong></div>
    <div>
        The collected data will be stored for potential future research projects, which means that the data might be used in another unrelated research project.
        The data may also be made available to other researchers (e.g., through the open access policy of some journals that requires the data be publicly available at the time of publication).
        Making data public has the potential for increasing participating risk.
        However, the data will be de-identified prior to being shared, so any information in the data cannot be used to identify you.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Compensation</strong></div>
    <div>
        You will be compensated with course credit (0.5 point/half hour) after you have finished your tasks. There will be no cost to you for your participation.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <div><strong>Your participation is voluntary</strong></div>
    <div>
        Your participation in this research is voluntary.
        You may discontinue participation at any point in the study, and your data will be destroyed immediately, in which case you will still be compensated for your time.
        However, please note that once the data is made publicly available, you will not be able to withdraw your data. Whether or not you cease participation will have no bearing on your relationship with us, the Linguistics Department, or UBC.
